# mySummerGame
The game is a battle-system that draws inspiration from several games I have played in my life. It serves as a project of learning for me as this is the first complete battle system I have ever created. The goal is to get it finished during my summer break, it will be finished once several things are implemented:

- The player can use one of 4 given actions to damage and/or disturb the ai
- The ai will provide the player a challenge by using some of its own given actions
- The player and the enemies will be displayed with sprites(drawn by yours truly)
- Battles run in real time, with an uncapped frame-rate at aprox. 100 updates per second(i.e. the frames should not update logic!)
- Enemies consist of at least two different types, one of which is a boss
- Transitions for each state are present(states: Start, Mid-battle, PlayerDeath and PlayerVictory)
- Ideally, the player will fight 3 rounds against normal enemies before encountering the boss(but this depends on the ai development process and how many enemies I can create)
- The in-game objects get resized relative to the windowsize to support different resolutions
- Some kind of in-game sound like music and/or sound effects

Realistically I find it hard to believe I can get everything done and I would consider it a success if I get half of these finished on time.

I have an overarching story in mind for the game, should it get bigger than the current small battlesystem, I will attempt to display characteristics and atmosphere trough the visuals I create.

For future implementations after the deadline I would like to consider:
- Pieces of equipment or "gear"
- Character specific abilities
- Voice acting
- A possible multiplayer mode: PvP, PvE or both.
- ...a better visual direction...
